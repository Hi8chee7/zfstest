Usage: zfstest.sh devicename
Where devicename should be a blockdevice of 1GB.
The script roughly does the following steps:
- create a zfs filesystem in the blockdevice
- create a 800MB file in this filesystem containing zeroes
- shasum this file
- change a single byte in the blockdevice
- flush caches
- shasum again (the checksum sometimes differs from the first one indicating a file corruption, this might be a bug in shasum that needs investigation)
- check the output of zpool status (even if the above checksums differ, zfs does not reliably show an error)

You might need to run this script multiple times to trigger the issue. If the error is triggered it prints "the pool is silently corrupted" in red letters.
